# VQE
In this project, I have built a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), which is a quantum computing algorithm that is capable of finding the ground state of a given molecular configuration. The algorithm involves defining the molecular configuration and hamiltonian for the system, constructing a quantum circuit to model the system, and optimizing the circuit to minimize the ground state energy.  The Python library Pennylane was used to automate most of this process.  For a more in depth look at the VQE, I have attached my report in this repository as VQE_Report.pdf.  In the Jupyter notebook, I have looked at the $H_2$ molecule, determining the ground state energy at various bond lengths.  The code could easily be modified to represent different molecules, however.
