# VQE
In this project, I have built a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), which is a quantum computing algorithm that is capable of finding the ground state of a given molecular configuration using the variational method. The algorithm involves defining the molecular configuration, defining the hamiltonian for the system, constructing a quantum circuit to model the system. and optimizing the circuit to minimize the ground state energy.  The Python library Pennylane was used to automate most of this process.  For a more in depth look at the VQE, I have attached my report in this repository
